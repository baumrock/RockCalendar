# Translations

RockCalendar ships with german and finnish translations.

All you have to do to use these translations is to install [RockLanguage](https://www.baumrock.com/RockLanguage) and set the correct language mapping, eg `your-language-name=FI` to use translations in the `FI` folder, or `german=DE` to use the german translations.
