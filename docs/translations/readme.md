# Translations

RockCalendar ships with german and finnish translations.

All you have to do to use these translations is to install [RockLanguage](https://www.baumrock.com/RockLanguage) and set the correct language mapping, eg `your-language-name=FI` to use translations in the `FI` folder

## Example

Let's say you have added "German" as second language and you gave that page the name "german".

The correct mapping would be `german=DE`.

If you gave the page the name "de" to make it accessible via example.com/de, then the mapping would be `de=DE`.
